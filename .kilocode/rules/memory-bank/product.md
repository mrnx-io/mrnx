# Product: KINETIC-CORTEX

## Why This Project Exists

KINETIC-CORTEX exists to solve the **decision paralysis** Dutch BV owners face when choosing between bank financing and lending from their own company. The fiscal complexity of Box 1/2/3 taxation, WOZ implications, and opportunity costs makes this a multi-variable optimization problem that most people get wrong.

## Problems Solved

| Problem | Current Pain | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Fiscal Complexity** | Box 1/2/3 tax interactions are opaque | Visual breakdown with yearly matrix |
| **Comparison Difficulty** | Bank vs BV scenarios require spreadsheet expertise | Side-by-side real-time comparison |
| **Hidden Costs** | Opportunity cost of BV capital often ignored | Alternative yield calculation built-in |
| **Decision Anxiety** | No trusted tools for Dutch fiscal specifics | Premium, accurate calculator |

## How It Works

### User Experience
1. Land on neural visualization (brand impression)
2. Navigate to Wealth Architect calculator
3. Adjust loan parameters using sliders/inputs
4. View real-time comparison results:
   - Cumulative system advantage (delta)
   - Bank scenario breakdown
   - BV scenario breakdown
   - 30-year financial matrix

### Quality Goals

| Goal | Target |
|------|--------|
| Visual impression | Premium, trust-building |
| Calculation accuracy | 100% Dutch fiscal compliance |
| Performance | 60fps 3D rendering, <100ms calculation |
| Mobile support | Responsive design (desktop-first) |
